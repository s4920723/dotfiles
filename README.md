# My dotfiles
A collection of configuration files for my linux desktop mostly focused around the i3-gaps window manager. Nothing
too fancy since almost everything works fine for me from the box.

List of other programs that I run on my desktop:
* i3-gaps
* i3blocks-gaps
* st (Luke Smith's fork)
* i3lock-color
* flashfocus
* pywal
* compton
* nm-applet
* lightdm-gtk-greeter
* amixer
* pulseaudio-equalizer
* xbacklight
* xkblayout-state
* Noto fonts
* Font Awesome 4
